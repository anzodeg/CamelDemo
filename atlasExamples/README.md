Comments added to explain their workflow

Complexity-wise:
 - basic.java corresponds to [camel-example-atlasmap](https://github.com/atlasmap/atlasmap/tree/main/examples/camel3/camel-example-atlasmap) and is the simplest
 - multidoc.java corresponds to [camel-example-atlasmap-multidoc](https://github.com/atlasmap/atlasmap/tree/main/examples/camel3/camel-example-atlasmap-multidoc) and is similar in scope to what we will be doing with Camel
 - msg.java corresponds to [camel-example-atlasmap-msgmap](https://github.com/atlasmap/atlasmap/tree/main/examples/camel3/camel-example-atlasmap-msgmap) and has extra complexity that doesn't add anything in terms of funcionality
