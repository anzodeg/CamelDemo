# Setting everything up
run app/src/main/java/App.java to convert sample hl7 message to fhir

Project shows how to use Atlas Mapping files via Camel Routes

Also demonstrates use of HAPI hl7 to xml parser

Planning to expand example then look at turning this into a jar to host in cloud

Also want to figure out what log statements generated by atlas map mean
